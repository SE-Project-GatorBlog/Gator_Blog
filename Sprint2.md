### 3.1 Reasons for Not Implementing Certain Features

- **Commenting on Blog Posts:** This feature was deprioritized in Sprint 1 as the focus was on establishing core authentication and backend setup. It will be implemented in the next sprint.  
- **Liking Blog Posts:** Implementing a like feature requires additional modifications to the database schema and was planned for a future sprint to maintain the sprint timeline.  
- **Editing blog posts after publishing** Editing functionality requires implementing version control and additional backend logic, which were deprioritized for this sprint. 

---

## 5. Testing:
- Verified API responses using Postman for all CRUD operations.
- Conducted UI testing for blog post management and user profile authentication using Cypress.
- Validated authentication security for user-specific content access.
- Debugged and resolved inconsistencies in API responses using mock databases.
  
### 5.1 Backend Testing:
#### Blog_test:
The unit tests in `blog_test.go` focus on testing the Blog API functionality, ensuring that various scenarios related to fetching blog posts work correctly.

#### Test Setup:
- Uses an **in-memory SQLite database** to simulate a real database environment for testing.
- Initializes test data, including a sample user and blog posts.
- Implements middleware to set user authentication context.

#### Test Cases:

| **Test Case** | **Description** |
|--------------|----------------|
| **TestBlogListUnauthorized** | Ensures that an unauthenticated user gets an error when trying to fetch blogs. |
| **TestBlogListEmpty** | Checks that a user with no blog posts gets an empty list response. |
| **TestBlogListWithBlogs** | Verifies that a user with multiple blogs receives a list of their own blogs. |
| **TestBlogListUserNotFound** | Ensures an error response if the requested user does not exist. |
| **TestBlogListDatabaseError** | Simulates a database failure and checks if the API handles it gracefully. |
| **TestBlogListUserSegregation** | Validates that users only see their own blogs and not other users' posts. |

These tests ensure that the blog fetching functionality works correctly under different conditions, covering authentication, database integrity, and error handling.

#### Users_test:
The unit tests in `users_test.go` focus on testing the authentication functionality of the Gator Blog platform, ensuring that user registration (`SignUp`) and authentication (`SignIn`) work correctly under various conditions.

#### Test Setup:
- Uses an **in-memory SQLite database** to simulate a real database environment for testing.
- Initializes the database with user data for authentication tests.
- Configures API routes for signup and login.

#### Test Cases:

| **Test Case** | **Description** |
|--------------|----------------|
| **TestSignUpSuccess** | Ensures that a new user can successfully register and receive a valid token. |
| **TestSignUpDuplicateEmail** | Validates that users cannot register with an email that is already taken. |
| **TestSignUpDuplicateUsername** | Ensures that duplicate usernames are not allowed during registration. |
| **TestSignUpInvalidJSON** | Tests handling of malformed JSON requests during signup. |
| **TestSignInSuccess** | Verifies that an existing user can successfully log in and receive a token. |
| **TestSignInUserNotFound** | Ensures an error response when a non-existent user attempts to log in. |
| **TestSignInIncorrectPassword** | Validates that incorrect passwords return an authentication error. |
| **TestSignInInvalidJSON** | Checks if the API properly handles malformed JSON requests during login. |
| **TestSignInMissingFields** | Ensures that missing fields in login requests result in an appropriate error response. |
| **TestJWTTokenValidation** | Validates the JWT authentication process, ensuring tokens are correctly generated and verified. |
| **TestMalformedContentType** | Ensures that requests with incorrect content types are properly handled. |
| **TestDatabaseErrorHandling** | Simulates database errors to test how the API handles failures during authentication. |

These tests ensure the robustness of authentication mechanisms, preventing issues like duplicate accounts, incorrect logins, and handling edge cases efficiently.

### 5.2 Frontend Testing:
#### Using Cypress testing:
The Cypress tests in `spec.cy.js` focus on testing the frontend functionality of the Gator Blog platform, ensuring that key user interface elements and authentication flows work correctly.

#### Test Setup:
- Uses **Cypress** for end-to-end testing of the frontend components.
- Simulates user interactions such as form submissions, navigation, and authentication.
- Validates UI behavior and API integration.

#### Test Cases:

| **Test Case** | **Description** |
|--------------|----------------|
| **TestLoginPage** | Ensures the login page loads correctly and allows users to sign in successfully. |
| **TestSignUpPage** | Verifies that users can register successfully and validation errors are displayed for incorrect inputs. |
| **TestDashboardPage** | Confirms that the dashboard loads correctly and displays user-specific content. |
| **TestHomePage** | Validates that the homepage loads properly and blog posts are listed as expected. |
| **TestForgotPasswordPage** | Ensures users can reset their passwords and receive a confirmation message. |
| **TestCreateBlogPost** | Tests the ability to create a new blog post and validate input fields. |
| **TestEditBlogPost** | Ensures that users can edit their blog posts and see updated content. |
| **TestDeleteBlogPost** | Verifies that users can delete their blog posts and receive confirmation. |
| **TestNavigation** | Checks that the navigation bar functions correctly, allowing users to move between pages. |
| **TestLogout** | Ensures that users can log out and are redirected to the login page. |

These tests ensure the frontend UI functions smoothly, validating both user interactions and API responses.

#### Frontend Unit Tests:
The frontend unit tests focus on verifying the rendering of key UI components in the Gator Blog platform using **React Testing Library**. These tests ensure that essential buttons, images, and navigation elements are present on the homepage.

#### Test Setup:
- Uses React Testing Library for unit testing.
- Wraps components in `MemoryRouter` to simulate routing behavior.
- Verifies rendering of UI elements based on user expectations.

#### Test Cases:

| **Test Case** | **Description** |
|--------------|----------------|
| **TestStartBloggingButton** | Ensures the "START BLOGGING" button is rendered on the homepage. |
| **TestHomeButton** | Verifies that the "HOME" button is present in the UI. |
| **TestMyProfileButton** | Confirms that the "MY PROFILE" button is correctly displayed. |
| **TestGatorImage** | Ensures that the Gator image is rendered properly. |
| **TestPostsButton** | Checks that the "POSTS" button appears in the interface. |

These tests help maintain UI consistency by ensuring critical elements are correctly displayed and accessible to users.
